## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- a1bad11: Update dev dependencies. This should not affect component users, but gives Svelte compiler warnings.
- 4a9faf0: Switched the `overflow-y` from `scroll` to `auto` so you don't get the scroll bars showing up if not needed.
- 4a9faf0: Capture `keypress` in addition to `click` event on the scrim, to more accurately close the panel on mobile devices.
